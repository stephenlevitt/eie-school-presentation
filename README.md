## A presentation explaining Electrical and Information Engineering to high school students

This presentation is targeted at high school students in grades 10 and 11. It consists mostly of pictures and takes about 20 to 25 minutes to present, depending on how in-depth you want the discussion to be. The goal is to give students a vision of what electrical and information engineers do. The presentation does not deal with the curriculum, the different degree options, and so on. 

### Editing the presentation

This is a Beamer presentation written in LaTeX. It is compiled using the *XeLaTeX* engine. 

The presentation uses a Beamer theme which has been slightly modified as well as a number of other packages. These can be obtained from [here](https://github.com/stephenlevitt/SPL-LaTeX) (see the `spl` and `beamer/base/themes` directories). In order to edit and compile the presentation you need to make these theme modifications and packages accessible to your LaTeX build system.
