# A presentation explaining Electrical and Information Engineering to high school students.

This presentation is targeted at high school students in grades 10 and 11.

## Editing the presentation

This is a Beamer presentation written in LaTeX. It is compiled using the *XeLaTeX* engine. 

The presentation uses a Beamer theme which has been slightly modified as well as a number of other packages. In order to edit and compile the presentation you need to include these theme modifications and packages in your `texmf` tree. These can be obtained from [here](https://github.com/stephenlevitt/SPL-LaTeX) (see the `spl` and `beamer/base/themes` directories).
